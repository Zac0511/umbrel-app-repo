This is [Zac0511](https://github.com/Zac0511)'s UmbrelOS app stores that is made for apps that he uses, but that maintainers from other community app stores were not updating.

The reason i made this is that i wanted to use Crafty Controller from [Denny's Umbrel App Store](https://github.com/dennysubke/dennys-umbrel-app-store), but since no one was updating it to the latest version and no one was merging my pull request idk i made my own repo, at least i can update the app myself here.

Fell free to add the repo to your Umbrel OS too by typing `https://github.com/Zac0511/umbrel-app-repo/` in the "Add Community App store" menu of your UmbrelOS App store.
